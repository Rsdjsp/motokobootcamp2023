1. True or False: we can prevent the heap being erased during upgrades by using a stable heap.

R:True, we can prevent the heap being erased always if the type of the variable can be stable, in example, a class cannot be stable


2. A.call() -> B.call() -> C How much time (or rounds of consensus) do we need to wait for an answer?

R: If the canisters are on the same subnet, you will need 2 rounds of consensus, one round is equivalent to 2 seconds, so 2*2 = 4 seconds. If the canisters are on different subnets, you will need 4 rounds of consensus, so 4*2 = 8 seconds.


3. Is possible to realize an intercanister call in query mode?

R: Yes, it is possible
